Face mask detection is an AI-powered technology that identifies whether a person is wearing a face mask in real-time, typically using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It has gained prominence in recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a tool for promoting public health and safety. 

How it works:
Face mask detection systems generally involve a few key steps:

Face Detection: The system first identifies and locates faces within images or video streams, even if partially obscured by a mask. This can involve using algorithms like MTCNN or RetinaFace.
Feature Extraction: Advanced algorithms, often utilizing deep neural networks, focus on visible facial features, especially the eye and forehead regions, to create a detailed map.
Mask Presence & Classification: The extracted features are then fed into a classification model, often a convolutional neural network (CNN), to determine whether a mask is present and if it's being worn correctly (e.g., covering both the nose and mouth).
Output and Action: The system can provide a binary output (mask detected/not detected) or offer more detailed information about the mask's type and placement. If a violation is detected, the system can trigger alerts, notifications (like push notifications or emails), or integrate with other systems like access control.
